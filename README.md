# 3DCube
Visualization of 3D rotation using python, pygame, and numpy.
This project utilizes 3D Rotation Matrices to compute the new values for the current x, y, z coordinates of the Cube, based on an angle - theta. With each iteration of the main program loop, theta is slowly incremented, the new coordinates for each point on the cube are calculated and added to a temporary array, and finally drawn onto the screen. This project used the mathematical concept of rotation and a coordinate plane and it showed the applicability of mathematical ideas to programming projects.
